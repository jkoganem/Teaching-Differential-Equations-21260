    "## Implicit Solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the last notebook that in the process of solving a separable equation, we first at a relation between the dependent and independent variable first, and then we try to write the dependent variable as a function of the independent variable. However, not all relations can be easily solved for the dependent variable. For this reason, we introduce the notion of an **implicit solution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**:\n",
    "> A function $G: I \\times \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined via $G(x,y) = 0$ defines an **implicit solution** to a first order differential equation over an interval $I$ if there exists a $C^1$ function $f: I \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $G(x,f(x)) = 0$ for all $x \\in I$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:**\n",
    "We will assume in this class that if an identity of the form $G(x,y) = 0$ can be derived in the process of manipulating equations, then there exists an interval $I$ and a differentiable function $y$ for which $G(x,y(x)) = 0$ for all $x \\in I$. Investigating when a relation of the form $G(x,y) = 0$ defines a differentiable function requires the *implicit function theorem*, which is outside the scope of this course. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> Consider the differential equation, \n",
    "> $$y'(x) = -\\frac{x}{y(x)}, \\; x \\in I.$$\n",
    "> We claim that the relation \n",
    "> $$G(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - r^2 = 0, \\; (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}$$\n",
    "> for any constant $r \\neq 0$ defines an implicit solution to the equation. We note that via implicit differentiation, \n",
    "> $$2x + 2 y(x) y'(x) = 0, x \\in (-r,r),$$\n",
    "> therefore \n",
    "> $$y'(x) = -\\frac{x}{y(x)}, \\; x \\in (-r,r).$$\n",
    "> We note that in this case it is possible to solve for $y$ explicitly, a solution $y: (-r,r) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ can either be defined via $y(x) = \\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ or $y(x) = -\\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$. If an initial condition is given, then we choose the branch of the square root that satisfies the initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> Consider the initial value problem \n",
    "> $$\n",
    ">   \\begin{cases}\n",
    ">     (e^{2y(x)} - y(x)) \\cos(x) y'(x) = e^{y(x)} \\sin 2x, \\; x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\\\\n",
    ">     y(0) = 0.\n",
    ">  \\end{cases}\n",

    "> $$\n",
    ">    \\frac{e^{2y(x)} - y(x)}{e^{y(x)}} y'(x) = \\frac{\\sin 2x}{\\cos x} = 2 \\sin x, \\;x \\in I.\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> Thus we have the identity \n",
    "> $$\n",
    ">    \\int (e^y - ye^{-y}) \\; dy = 2 \\int \\sin x \\; dx.\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> This leads us to the implicit relation\n",
