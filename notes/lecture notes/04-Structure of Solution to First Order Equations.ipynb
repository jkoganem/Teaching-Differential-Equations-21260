    "Suppose $I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is an interval and $a_0, a_1, f: I \\to \\mathbb{R}$ are continuous functions. Consider the first order linear equation\n",

    "Recall that if $f$ is not the zero function over $I$, then we refer to this equation as an inhomogeneous equation and any solution to this equation as an inhomogeneous solution. We can also write down the associated homogeneous equation \n",
    "$$\n",
    "a_1(x) y'(x) + a_0(x) y (x) = 0 , \\; x \\in I,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and any solution to this equation is called a homogeneous solution.\n",

    "We can write this equation abstractly in the following way. Define $L: C^1(I ; \\mathbb{R}) \\to C^0(I ; \\mathbb{R})$ via \n",

    "Some terminology:\n",
    "1. We say that a parametrized function $y$ is a *general solution to the inhomogeneous problem* if any solution to the inhomogeneous problem can be realized as the parametrized function $y$ evaluated at a specific value of the associated parameter.\n",
    "2. Similarly, we can define general solutions to the homogeneous problem.\n",
    "3. We say that $y_p$ is a *particular solution to the inhomogeneous problem* if it is a parameter-free solution to the inhomogeneous problem.\n",
    "4. Similarly, we can define particular solutions to the homogeneous problem.\n",
