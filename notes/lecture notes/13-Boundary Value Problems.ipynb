    "If a differential equation is coupled with conditions specified at two different points, then we refer to these conditions as **boundary condition**s (as opposed to initial conditions) and the associated problem as a **boundary value problem (BVP)**. Many physical systems are naturally modeled by boundary value problems. \n",

The eigenvalues correspond to the allowed energy levels of a quantum system, and the eigenfunctions correspond to the wave functions of the system at those energy levels. \n",
