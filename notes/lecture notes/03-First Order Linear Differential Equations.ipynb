    "### A Precautionary Tale\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "> Suppose we want to find all solutions to $x + \\sqrt{x} = 0$. Upon first try most students would likely write something like this:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> x + \\sqrt{x} = 0 \\implies x = -\\sqrt{x} \\implies x^2 = (-\\sqrt{x})^2 = x  \\implies x^2 - x = 0 \\implies x(x-1) = 0  \\implies x = 0 \\; \\text{or} \\; x =  1,\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> and then conclude that the solutions are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n",
    "> However, this isn't quite right, because what we've really shown above is that \"if $x$ solves $x + \\sqrt{x} = 0$, then the candidate solutions are $x = 0$ or $x=1$.\"\n",
    "> In order to verify that the candidate solutions are actual solutions we actually need to evaluate the converse. \n",
    "> We note that if $x = 0$, then $0 + \\sqrt{0} = 0$, so $x=0$ is a solution, but if $x =1$, then $1 + \\sqrt{1} = 2 \\neq 0$, so $x = 1$ is not a solution. So the correct conclusion is that the only solution to the equation is $x = 0$. \n",
    "> In this case we can write the conclusion as a bi-implication,\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> x + \\sqrt{x } = 0 \\; \\text{if and only if} \\; x = 0.\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> Now if in the above every forward implication is a bi-implication, then the verification step can be skipped, but as we see in the example above when you naively manipulate equations sometimes the implication only goes one way (e.g. $x = 1$ implies $x^2 = 1$ but $x^2 = 1$ does not imply $x=1$ since it's possible for $x=-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The upshot here is that when one naively manipulates equations and do not pay close attention to the direction of the implications, the final \"answer\" is really a candidate set of solutions to the original equation, and a verification step is necessary for us to find the actual solution set. \n",
    "\n",
    "  This idea applies when we solve for differential equations too: students are often taught to naively manipulate equations and they are done once they reach the \"answer\", but in reality the final \"answer\" is only a candidate solution set because one typically do not pay attention to the direction of the implications, and a final verification step is necessary for the argument to be mathematically and logically precise. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Furthermore, to be absolutely precise one also should identify the interval of existence associated to the solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy for Solving Differential Equations\n",
    "1. Recognize the type of differential equation you are trying to solve (classification).\n",
    "2. Apply appropriate techniques to manipulate the equation and derive a candidate solution.\n",
    "3. From the candidate solution set, identify the interval(s) $J$ on which the solution(s) can be defined.\n",
    "4. Verify that the candidate solution(s) solve the differential equation on $J$.\n",
    "5. For IVPs, you also need to identify the interval(s) $J$ that contains $t_0$ and check that the initial conditions specified at $t_0$ are satisfied.\n",
