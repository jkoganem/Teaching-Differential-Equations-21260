    "## The Laplace transform\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition**\n",
    "> We define the *Laplace transform* of a function $ f: [0,\\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R} $ to be \n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} (s) := \\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\; dt\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "> for all values $ s \\in \\mathbb{R} $ for which the improper integral converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we proceed we make the following remarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Here $ \\mathcal{L}\\{ f \\}(s) $ is a function of $ s $: the Laplace transform takes in a function $ f $ as an input and gives back a function of $ s $, $ F(s) := \\mathcal{L}\\{f \\} (s) $, where $ s $ is real-valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We often adopt the following abuse of notation: one, we sometimes omit the $ s $ and simply write $ \\mathcal{L} \\{f\\} $ instead. Two, we also sometimes write $ \\mathcal{L} \\{f(t)\\} $ even though it is more appropriate to write $ \\mathcal{L} \\{f(\\cdot)\\} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The integral appearing in the definition of the Laplace transform is an improper integral:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int_0^\\infty e^{-st} f(t) \\; dt = \\lim\\limits_{\\gamma \\to \\infty} \\int_0^\\gamma e^{-st} f(t) \\; dt.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The improper integral may not be well-defined for a particular value of $ s $ and $ f $ (i.e. the integral may not converge). In general, the Laplace transform is only well-defined for certain values of $ s $; in the section to follow we give sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of the Laplace transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The main utility of the Laplace transform for us is that it allows us to solve inhomogeneous linear equations where the forcing function on the right-hand side is only piecewise continuous or sometimes not even a classical function. The idea is as follows: given an ODE of the form $ Lu = f $, where $ L $ is some differential operator, one can transform the original ODE of the unknown function $ u $ to an algebraic equation $ \\mathcal{L} \\{Lu\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{f\\} $ in the $ s $-domain for the Laplace transform $ U = \\mathcal{L}\\{u\\} $ by using the Laplace transform. We'll see that this equation is generally easier to solve than the original ODE since it is an algebraic equation. Once we obtain a solution $ U $ in the $ s $-domain, we can obtain a solution $ u $ to the original ODE by \"undoing\" $ \\mathcal{L} $, i.e. by taking the inverse Laplace transform $ \\mathcal{L}^{-1} $. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. The Laplace transform is a special type of an *integral transform*. In general, they are of the form \n",
    "$$\n",
    "T\\{f\\}(s) = \\int_{D} K(s,t) f(t) \\; dt, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $f: \\mathbb{F} \\to \\mathbb{F}$ is the input function, $K: \\mathbb{F} \\times \\mathbb{F} \\to \\mathbb{F}$ is the *kernel* of the integral transform, $D \\subseteq \\mathbb{F}$ and usually $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{R}$ or $\\mathbb{F} = \\mathbb{C}$. The Laplace transform is a special case of this where $K(s,t) = e^{-st}$. Other examples of integral transforms include the Fourier transform, the Mellin transform, the Hankel transform, etc. See the discussion [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_transform) for more details.

    "> \n",
    "> We can also define analogously the notion of piecewise smooth functions, which are functions for which the function is smooth (smooth meaning that all derivatives of the function are well-defined and continuous) restricted to the interior of each subinterval on which the function is continuous.\n",
