    "## Classification of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by giving a general definition of a differential equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**  \n",
    "An equation containing the derivatives of one or more unknown functions, with respect to one or more independent variables, is called a *differential equation* (DE). \n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some vague but general principles, which may be useful to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. Nonlinear equations are more difficult to analyze than linear equations.\n",
    "2. Higher-order equations are more difficult to analyze than lower-order equations.\n",
    "3. Systems are harder to analyze than scalar equations.\n",
    "4. Partial differential equations are harder to analyze than ODEs.\n",
    "5. **For most differential equations it is not possible to write out explicit formulas for solutions.**\n",
    "6. None of these assertions are without important exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For these reasons, we first aim to classify differential equations into different classes to make studying them more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classification: Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) vs. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this class is on ordinary differential equations defined over intervals (not a union of intervals), which we define below. First, we define the notion of an interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**  \n",
    "A set $ I \\subseteq \\mathbb{R} $ is said to be an interval if $ I $ is of the following forms for $ a,b \\in \\mathbb{R} $ with $ a < b $:\n",
    "> $$ [a,b], [a,b), (a,b], (a,b), [a,\\infty), (a,\\infty), (-\\infty,b], (-\\infty, b), (-\\infty,\\infty) = \\mathbb{R}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**  \n",
    "Let $ I $ be an interval and let $ n $ be a positive integer. A scalar *ordinary differential equation* (ODE) is an equation of the form \n",
    "> $$F(t,x(t),x'(t), \\ldots, x^{(n)}(t) ) = 0 \\; \\text{for all} \\; t \\in I, $$ \n",
    "> for some unknown function $ x: I \\to \\mathbb{R} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remark:**  Oftentimes in textbooks the interval $I$ is ignored, i.e. authors do not specify the interval that the ODE is defined on. Usually what they mean is that $I = \\R$, though this is not always the case and the interval $I$ has to be inferred through context. Solutions to differential equations depend on the interval $I$, therefore it is important to specify the interval on which the ODE is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**  \n",
    "If a differential equation involves partial derivatives of functions of two or more independent variables, then the equation is called a *partial differential equation* (PDE).\n",

    "\n",
    "### Classification: Order of Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition**  \n",
    "The *order* of a differential equation is the order of the highest derivative in the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to the definition of the degree of a polynomial. For polynomials, the roots of higher degree polynomials are usually much harder to identify than the roots of a quadratic or a linear polynomial. This heuristic roughly translates over to differential equations as well, that higher order equations are usually harder to solve than lower order equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this heuristic, the first class of ODEs that we will learn to solve explicitly are first order ODEs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**  \n",
    "The equation $y' + y = 0$ is a first order ODE.\n",

    "**Example**  \n",
    "The equation $y'' - y = 0$ is a second order ODE.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**  \n",
    "The equation $\\partial_{xx} y + \\partial_{yy} y= 0$ is a second order PDE.\n",

    "2. The domain of the differential equation (e.g. solving over a bounded interval vs the entire real line, or more general domains in higher dimensions).\n",

    "> on the interval $J = (-\\infty, \\infty)$. To check this we first note that for all $x \\in J$, $y'(x) = -3e^{-x} = -y(x)$, therefore $y$ is a solution to the ODE. Then, we check that $y(0) = 3e^{0}= 3$, therefore $y$ is also a solution to the IVP on the interval $J$.\n"
